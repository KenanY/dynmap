# Dynmap - Realtime Minecraft maps

## Fork

This is a fork of the [main Dynmap repository](https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap). This fork focuses on the web front-end of Dynmap, instead of the Java that's working behind the scenes. Minifying CSS and JavaScript files is one thing that should come to mind.

### Installation

_Note that these are the installation instructions for this fork, not the original Dynmap repository_

Because I've been having trouble compiling the Dynmap source, the only way currently available to install this fork is to [download it](https://github.com/KenanY/dynmap/downloads), unzip it, then go to `dynmap/web` and overwrite your current Dynmap installation (found in `plugins/dynmap`) with that folder.

## What is Dynmap?

[Dynmap][] was started by k-zed as a plugin for hMod. The plugin was ported to [Bukkit][] soon after Bukkit was released. The current version of Dynmap provides an in-browser map, like [Google Maps][], of your [Minecraft][] world. It updates the map in realtime while you have your browser opened and shows the current players, regions and in-game messages on top of the map. It also allows viewers of the map to chat from within their browser with players in-game.

### Features

* Configurable maps of different types
* Configurable color-schemes
* Realtime players (with portraits) on map
* Mark places that will show on the map
* Two-way chatting through web and Minecraft
* Time on map
* Weather on map
